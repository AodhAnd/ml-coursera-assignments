# Coursera machine learning code
This repo contains all my code answers to the assignment from Andrew Ng's machine learning course on Coursera.
This is only my personal implementation and there are other (better?) ways to address these simple problems. 

## Disclaimer
Since, this the code here is my answer to the mentioned course assignments, some parts of it are not the result of my work but the base code given by Andrew Ng. All the rest is the result of my work.
